  <h2>When to use this pattern</h2>
  <p>If you use cookies to collect personal data in your service you should follow this pattern.</p>
  <p>Use this pattern to help users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>agree to your service using cookies to collect personal data</li>
    <li>set and change their cookie preferences</li>
    <li>understand why and how cookies are being used</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When not to use this pattern</h2>
  <p>Do not use this pattern if you are not using cookies to collect personal data in your service.</p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>When using this pattern you need to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ask users for consent</li>
    <li>provide information on the cookies you use</li>
    <li>allow users to change their settings</li>
    <li>inform users of any changes</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ask users for consent</h3>
  <p>Use a cookie banner to ask users for consent that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>appears the first time a service is used</li>
    <li>loads immediately with the page</li>
    <li>persists until the user updates their settings</li>
    <li>sits above the site header and users can scroll past it</li>
  </ul>

  <img class="app-image--border app-example--image" src="/assets/cookie-banner.png" alt="">

  <p>The banner includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a clear, accessible heading</li>
    <li>a simple explanation that we’ve set essential cookies</li>
    <li>information about analytics cookies, so users can give informed consent</li>
    <li>information about an extra, non-essential cookie used to record the user’s choice</li>
    <li>a link to our more detailed cookies information page, if the user needs it</li>
    <li>descriptive buttons of equal prominence to allow users to make a quick, unbiased choice</li>
  </ul>

  <img class="app-image--border app-example--image" src="/assets/cookie-banner-anatomy.png" alt="">

  <p>When users update their settings using the cookie banner, use a confirmation banner to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>confirm the users choice</li>
    <li>let users know they can change their settings</li>
    <li>link to the cookies information page</li>
  </ul>

  <img class="app-image--border app-example--image" src="/assets/cookie-banner-confirm.png" alt="">

  <h3>Tell people about the cookies you use</h3>
  <p>Let users gain a better understanding of the cookies used with a cookies information page that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>explains clearly what cookies are
    <li>explains what the cookies are used for
    <li>includes a list of details about every essential cookie used
    <li>includes a link to update their preferences</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/our-policies/cookies-policy/">See the NHS websites cookies information page</a></p>

  <h3>Allow users to set and change their cookie settings</h3>
  <p>Let users set and change their settings with a cookies settings page that should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>clearly explain the cookie with a concise heading and description</li>
    <li>list each cookie including the name, purpose and time it expires</li>
    <li>include descriptive radio buttons for users to make a choice</li>
    <li>include a ‘Save my cookie settings’ button, aligned left and the bottom of the page</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/our-policies/cookies-policy/cookie-settings/">See the NHS websites cookie settings page</a></p>

  <h3>Tell users about any changes</h3>
  <p>After users save their changes on the cookies settings page, direct users to a confirmation page that tells them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>you have saved their settings
    <li>how long you have saved their settings for
    <li>they can change their settings at any time (with a link to the cookies policy page)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>An example of a confirmation page:</p>
  <img class="app-image--border app-example--image" src="/assets/cookie-saved.png" alt="">

  <h3>Allow users to change preferences</h3>
  <p>Include a ‘cookies’ link in the footer so users can access the cookies information page from every page in the service.</p>

  <h2>Research on this pattern</h2>

  <p>The cookie banner on the NHS website has been live since November 2019.</p>
  <p>The original aim was to get 10% of users allowing us to use analytics cookies. This meant they could avoid forcing users into a decision, while still making sure their analytics data had statistical significance.</p>
  <p>By comparing server records of how many times the banner is displayed to the number of users allowing analytics cookies, they worked out that roughly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>75% of users don’t interact with the banner</li>
    <li>5% of users reject analytics cookies</li>
    <li>20% of users allow analytics cookies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The team is very happy with these results. They now should have more than enough analytics data to work with. And the proportion of users not interacting with the banner suggests it’s not interrupting user journeys.</p>
